<!-- Project language file 3
For: seanpm2001/PhD-in-PHP
About:
I chose ASP (Action Server Pages) as the third project language file for this project (seanpm2001/PhD-in-PHP) as despite not being purely PHP, it is influenced by PHP. On 2022, November 23rd, I expanded this projects scope by including languages that are influenced by PHP as extra credit courses and assignments. ASP was the second language to come up after PHP. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
