<p>Project language file 4</p>
<p>For: seanpm2001/PhD-in-PHP</p>
<p>About:</p>
<p>I chose Jakarta Server Pages (JSP) as the fourth project language file for this project (seanpm2001/PhD-in-PHP) as despite not being purely PHP, it is influenced by PHP. On 2022, November 23rd, I expanded this projects scope by including languages that are influenced by PHP as extra credit courses and assignments.ar Jakarta Server Pages (JSP) was the third language to come up after PHP. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
